# v2.9.5 Android stability update

Version: `2.9.5+4084`  
Maintained repository: `liuchuancong/pure_live`  
Upstream baseline: `liuchuancong/pure_live@cc1f4dca`  
Release date: 2026-08-24

## Scope

- Merge the latest upstream master with real Git ancestry and preserve the repository's serial, local-first build policy.
- Fix Douyu H5 stream acquisition and downstream media requests reported by upstream issue #785.
- Audit every supported public platform interface and extend the gate from 29 checks to 36 checks.
- Harden the newly synchronized YY adapter without adding a native JavaScript runtime.
- Complete the follow-up for issue #784 by replacing the search platform `TabBar` with a bounded selector and hardening native/web search behavior.
- Build and publish only the Android arm64-v8a target requested for this release.

## Douyu root cause and repair

The earlier gate verified the encryption descriptor but never executed the complete path from H5 metadata to CDN bytes. The adapter also relied on one shared sample DID, a long-lived descriptor cache, a single API attempt, strict optional-field indexing, and no Douyu headers on the player's media request. Those gaps produced the same generic stream-read failure for different upstream response and CDN-policy changes.

v2.9.5 uses one random DID per process, sends matching browser headers and cookies, caps descriptor cache age at five minutes, and performs one forced-refresh retry. It validates API status before parsing, falls back when quality/CDN lists are partial, deduplicates lines, decodes escaped URLs, and passes Referer/Origin/User-Agent/Cookie to every playback backend.

The interface probe now selects an active room, reproduces the Dart signing path, obtains H5 playback metadata, validates quality and CDN fields, downloads a byte range with the real player headers, and checks the `FLV` file signature.

## YY and upstream integration

- Keep upstream YY categories, recommendations, playback, danmaku, account route, assets and translations.
- Parse the three category query literals directly in Dart and remove `flutter_js` from runtime dependencies and generated plugin registrants.
- Normalize HTTP and protocol-relative URLs to HTTPS.
- Query `/api/liveInfoDetail/{sid}/{sid}/0` directly so live/offline refresh no longer depends on brittle room-page HTML or reports every room as live.
- Correct room search and anchor search response types, identifiers, avatar fields and `liveOn` values.
- Fix the account page to observe `yyCookie` rather than the Huya Cookie.
- Parse localized audience values before sorting multiview room choices.

## Search follow-up and root cause

The v2.9.4 patch gave the scrollable `TabBar` clamping physics, but the widget still combined its own tab-selection animation with an internal horizontal position even though this page has no matching `TabBarView`. That left the visible strip and the controller index coupled to two independent movement paths. Rebuilding `Sites.availableSites()` also created fresh adapter instances for labels, searching, pagination and web navigation; this could lose cursor state or map an index to a different snapshot.

v2.9.5 uses a dedicated clipped horizontal platform selector with an owned controller and clamped first/last boundaries. The search controller retains one immutable platform/adapter snapshot for its lifetime and changes platform through one bounded index method.

Cross-platform requests still run concurrently, but completed platforms are now rendered progressively and every individual request has a 12-second UI deadline. A stalled endpoint therefore no longer holds all results for the global 20-second HTTP timeout. Results remain generation-guarded, deduplicated and independently paginated. YY joins native search; requested page sizes now reach the Bilibili, Douyu, Huya, CC and SOOP endpoints.

The web-search room parser is now a pure tested component. It covers all nine applicable websites, rejects search/category pages and lookalike hosts, and returns both room ID and platform so a cross-site link cannot be opened by the wrong adapter. Invalid certificate challenges are cancelled rather than silently accepted.

## Verification

- Focused Douyu, YY, signing, search ranking, bounded platform-strip and web room-parser tests: 19 passed.
- Flutter Analyze: 0 issue (one final invocation after source freeze).
- Full unit/Widget suite: 332/332 passed.
- Public interface probes: 36/36 passed in the final gate.
- Full gate record: `20260824T114355723Z-quality-full.json`; 455.789 seconds, peak monitored working set 9.16 GiB, no active heavy process left after completion.
- Android package verification: pending final arm64-v8a release build and official repository signing.

## Artifact

| Platform | Target artifact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | `PureLive-2.9.5-4084-android-arm64-v8a-release.apk` | arm64-v8a, official repository certificate |

Windows, Linux, macOS and iOS continue to use v2.9.4 artifacts because they were outside this turn's requested build scope.

## Evidence boundary

This update uses source review, deterministic tests, live public API/CDN probes, build metadata, APK manifest/ABI inspection, checksum verification and certificate verification. It does not run ADB or automate a phone; device acceptance remains an independent post-release layer.
