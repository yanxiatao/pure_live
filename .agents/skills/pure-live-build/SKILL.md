# Pure Live Build

Before selecting or running a validation/build command, read [`../../../BUILD_POLICY.md`](../../../BUILD_POLICY.md). Treat it as the authoritative default for this repository.

## Workflow

1. Extract only the platform, architecture, configuration, validation scope, packaging, and publication actions explicitly requested in the current task.
2. Keep one platform/variant per build invocation. Queue Android, Windows, Linux, macOS, and iOS stages serially.
3. During development, use focused tests and target-platform Debug. Run Analyze once after edits settle.
4. Use full regression and target-platform Release only for formal delivery.
   A failed packaging stage may use `-SkipQuality` only when the same app source
   already passed full regression and the retry changes build/Gradle/release
   plumbing only; cite that prior run in the delivery report.
5. Enter the repository heavy-task guard before Gradle, Java, Dart, Flutter, or broad-search work. Default to 16 Gradle workers; use 20 only for an explicitly dedicated build. Start Flutter tests at concurrency 12.
6. Preserve incremental outputs and caches. Do not add a clean step unless evidence identifies damaged or incompatible generated state.
   Keep Configuration Cache in strict failure mode. Mark a confirmed incompatible
   Flutter aggregate task with `notCompatibleWithConfigurationCache` so Gradle
   discards only that entry instead of persisting incomplete state in warning mode.
   For Windows packaging, stage only files in the current CMake
   `install_manifest.txt` plus the reviewed runner-runtime allowlist; never copy
   the complete incremental Release directory, which can retain DLLs from removed plugins.
7. Report the generated build record and artifacts, then stop. Do not append another platform, full regression, package, upload, or release stage unless it was included in the current request.

Use `tool/local_ci.ps1` for focused/full validation and `tool/build_local_release.ps1` for the single explicitly selected local target.
