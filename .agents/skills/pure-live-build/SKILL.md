# Pure Live Build

Before selecting or running a validation/build command, read [`../../../BUILD_POLICY.md`](../../../BUILD_POLICY.md). Treat it as the authoritative default for this repository.

When the build follows a Bug fix, upstream Issue review or upstream merge, first complete the provenance, semantic review and evidence workflow in [`../../../MAINTENANCE_POLICY.md`](../../../MAINTENANCE_POLICY.md). A successful package is a build evidence layer, not a substitute for root-cause or compatibility review.

## Workflow

1. Extract the platform, architecture, configuration, validation scope, packaging, and publication actions from the current task. For a completed Bug-fix batch, apply `bugfix-android-release-default`: one patch/build increment, local Android arm64 Release, source push, GitHub fixed-certificate signing, Release publication, and release-index sync are standing scope. Treat multiple related fixes in one task as one version; other platforms remain explicit.
   For an upstream sync, freeze the full upstream SHA and run
   `tool/review_upstream_update.ps1` under `UPSTREAM_REVIEW_POLICY.md` before
   merging. The range must be merge-base-to-upstream, every incoming commit and
   file must be classified, and any incoming change requires a committed audit
   document plus explicit approval at the gate. After merging, run
   `python tool/audit_repository.py` before tests or packaging.
2. Keep one platform/variant per build invocation. Queue Android, Windows, Linux, macOS, and iOS stages serially.
3. During development, use focused tests and target-platform Debug. Run Analyze once after edits settle.
4. Use full regression and target-platform Release only for formal delivery.
   A failed packaging stage may use `-SkipQuality` only when the same app source
   already passed full regression and the retry changes build/Gradle/release
   plumbing only; cite that prior run in the delivery report.
5. Before staging or signing Android, run `tool/verify_android_apk.ps1`. Require the
   complete Flutter asset bundle, the single requested ABI, and the FFmpegKit,
   SQLite, MediaKit, Flutter, IJK and app native libraries; package metadata and
   signature checks alone are insufficient.
6. Android packaging consumes the package config produced by the preceding
   quality/dependency stage and uses `--no-pub`; do not regenerate unrelated
   desktop/Apple plugin links inside the Android Gradle invocation.
7. Enter the repository heavy-task guard before Gradle, Java, Dart, Flutter, or broad-search work. Default to 16 Gradle workers; use 20 only for an explicitly dedicated build. Start Flutter tests at concurrency 12. Classify work by sustained CPU/build-client activity so an `rg` process merely waiting on stdin does not block the queue indefinitely.
8. Preserve incremental outputs and caches. Do not add a clean step unless evidence identifies damaged or incompatible generated state.
   Keep Configuration Cache in strict failure mode. Mark a confirmed incompatible
   Flutter aggregate task with `notCompatibleWithConfigurationCache` so Gradle
   discards only that entry instead of persisting incomplete state in warning mode.
   For Windows packaging, stage only files in the current CMake
   `install_manifest.txt` plus the reviewed runner-runtime allowlist; never copy
   the complete incremental Release directory, which can retain DLLs from removed plugins.
9. Report the generated build record and artifacts. For a Bug-fix batch, continue only through the predeclared Android signing, GitHub Release, and index-sync stages; do not append another platform or a second full regression. For ordinary build requests, stop after the requested target.

Use `tool/local_ci.ps1` for focused/full validation and `tool/build_local_release.ps1` for the single explicitly selected local target.
